[{"content":"I recently played through Death Stranding and loved it so much I decided to check out the rest of Kojima\u0026rsquo;s famous work. Unfortunately Konami has made it pretty difficult to enjoy the entire Metal Gear series on modern systems. All the games are available, but usually not in the same package, none are on PS4, and the recent GOG PC releases are apparently the original not-great releases. There\u0026rsquo;s an HD collection on the PS3, that I planned on playing via PS Now (can\u0026rsquo;t stream PS3 without an HDCP stripper, which I\u0026rsquo;m not about to buy) but that starts with MGS2 for some reason. So it seems like the best way to play MGS1 today on a PC is to emulate the PlayStation release.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not super duper familiar with PS1 emulation, didn\u0026rsquo;t have one growing up so haven\u0026rsquo;t revisited the library too much in adulthood. I had a lot of trouble getting everything working right as these early 3D titles seem to really struggle to look good on modern systems, and there were a ton of visual glitches and artifacts. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to use RetroArch as much as possible for emulation lately as I really enjoy having everything in one place, and also it\u0026rsquo;s got a great community and is super configurable. Plus, it\u0026rsquo;s available on like every platform so it\u0026rsquo;s easier to keep things together across all my different devices. There are a ton of options though, and many different cores and renderers, but I seemed to have found a way to get the best of all worlds. So here\u0026rsquo;s my final configuration that seems to have it looking about as best as it can get, and with minimal issues. I have bolded/italicized what I think are the more important compatibility options.\nThis is for the Beetle PSX HW core, running at 16x internal res with the widescreen hack enabled.\nbeetle_psx_hw_adaptive_smoothing = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_analog_calibration = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_analog_toggle = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_aspect_ratio = \u0026ldquo;corrected\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_cd_access_method = \u0026ldquo;precache\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_cd_fastload = \u0026ldquo;2x(native)\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_core_timing_fps = \u0026ldquo;force_progressive\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_cpu_dynarec = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_cpu_freq_scale = \u0026ldquo;100%(native)\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_crop_overscan = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_depth = \u0026ldquo;32bpp\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_display_internal_fps = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_display_vram = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_dither_mode = \u0026ldquo;internal resolution\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_dump_textures = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_dynarec_eventcycles = \u0026ldquo;128\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_dynarec_invalidate = \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_enable_memcard1 = \u0026ldquo;enabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_enable_multitap_port1 = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_enable_multitap_port2 = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_filter = \u0026ldquo;nearest\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_filter_exclude_2d_polygon = \u0026ldquo;disable\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_filter_exclude_sprite = \u0026ldquo;disable\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_frame_duping = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_gpu_overclock = \u0026ldquo;1x(native)\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_gte_overclock = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_gun_cursor = \u0026ldquo;cross\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_gun_input_mode = \u0026ldquo;lightgun\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_image_crop = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_image_offset = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_image_offset_cycles = \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_initial_scanline = \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_initial_scanline_pal = \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_internal_resolution = \u0026ldquo;16x\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_last_scanline = \u0026ldquo;239\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_last_scanline_pal = \u0026ldquo;287\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_line_render = \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_mdec_yuv = \u0026ldquo;enabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_memcard_left_index = \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_memcard_right_index = \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_mouse_sensitivity = \u0026ldquo;100%\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_msaa = \u0026ldquo;1x\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_negcon_deadzone = \u0026ldquo;0%\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_negcon_response = \u0026ldquo;linear\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_pal_video_timing_override = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_pgxp_2d_tol = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_pgxp_mode = \u0026ldquo;memory only\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_pgxp_nclip = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_pgxp_texture = \u0026ldquo;enabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_pgxp_vertex = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_renderer = \u0026ldquo;hardware_vk\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_renderer_software_fb = \u0026ldquo;enabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_replace_textures = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_scaled_uv_offset = \u0026ldquo;enabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_shared_memory_cards = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_skip_bios = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_super_sampling = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_track_textures = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_use_mednafen_memcard0_method = \u0026ldquo;libretro\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_widescreen_hack = \u0026ldquo;enabled\u0026rdquo; beetle_psx_hw_wireframe = \u0026ldquo;disabled\u0026rdquo; You can either manually set these settings in the RetroArch GUI options menus or plop them all at once into wherever your core config is stored, mine was at\nC:\\Users\\Omar\\AppData\\Roaming\\RetroArch\\config\\Beetle PSX HW\\Beetle PSX HW.opt\nor if you\u0026rsquo;re using ROM specific options, it\u0026rsquo;s in the same folder but is named ROM-name.opt\nSome notes: some of this stuff is to taste, like 16x internal resolution and whether or not you want to use the widescreen hack (it works very well, though!). But the really critical thing is to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re using the Hardware Vulkan renderer, otherwise you will experience some extremely bad visual bugs whenever there are water effects or motion blur of any kind (as with the OpenGL renderer, see this issue on the core\u0026rsquo;s github). You should also make sure you have the software framebuffer enabled and have the PGXP mode set to \u0026ldquo;memory only.\u0026rdquo; This combination of settings has seemed to eliminate a good amount of the \u0026ldquo;wobble\u0026rdquo; of the textures in the game, has seemingly eliminated a weird bug I would get during cutscenes where half of the screen would be checkerboarded, and totally eliminated the water/blur issues. It also looks pretty good at 16x and is performant. I will say that there are some issues with textures on polygons having visible seams that pop in and out but I was not able to solve that with any settings, cores, or renderers other than running the game at native resolution, which I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. If you\u0026rsquo;re having issues with the game, try running with these settings and then once you confirm they work well start changing them one by one until it suits your tastes.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also heard that the Duckstation core solves some of the problems if you want to try that core, but it required more than 0 effort to get it to start using my existing saves for the game so I didn\u0026rsquo;t spend any time on it since this config solved my problems.\n","description":"","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Metal Gear Solid RetroArch Settings","uri":"http://ofsaleem.me/en/posts/metal-gear-solid-retroarch-settings/"},{"content":"over the past day i swapped my computer case to a new one. its real shiny and nice (fractal define 7, all white)\nit was a real PITA to put together because i have so many hard drives, i had to configure the case (which is modular and nearly fully disassemblable) into \u0026ldquo;storage mode\u0026rdquo; which involves taking apart most of the case and putting it back together differently. i also had issues following a lot of the instructions since i was trying probably too hard to plan ahead and make sure cable management would be easy and good when i was done\nspoiler alert unless you have custom length cables no matter how much time you put into cable management its always going to be like 75% good at best. you just can\u0026rsquo;t do enough with on-hand cables of various colors, lengths, thicknesses, materials, flat v. round, etc.\nonce it was finally put together, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t boot. which is an issue, of course. i just swapped cases, why would it not boot? most everything seemed fine in the bios, it detected my main m.2 ssd, but it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t let me boot from it! and my motherboard is one where if you have an m.2 sata SSD installed, it\u0026rsquo;ll disable the 1st regular sata port. i thought that was the issue at first but i had actually not mistakenly plugged a drive in to that disabled port.\nso long story short, part of the case migration was to no longer dual boot with windows and linux. so i didn\u0026rsquo;t actually migrate my linux drive over\u0026hellip;which had refind on it. so my boot manager was now totally missing, since i guess there was no remnant left on my windows os drive (even though it had the EFI partition). it\u0026rsquo;s still quite odd that i wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to boot from the disk manually since all my other random data drives were showing up as boot options in my bios but not the only actual OS disk\nso the fix (also have to make sure you have CSM and secure boot configured correctly) was to boot from a windows install USB (always nice to keep a windows usb and linux usb for shit like this), go into the advanced options and launch a command prompt. i needed to do it this way since the installer didnt detect any OSes and i obviously didn\u0026rsquo;t want to fresh install\nthen\nbootrec /scanos\nwhich will show you if it detects operating systems that aren\u0026rsquo;t in the BCD store, and if it finds what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for,\nbootrec /rebuildbcd\nwhich will give you the option of rebuilding the BCD with that OS.\noddly it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up as a UEFI boot in my bios, but honestly, whatever. it boots consistently and everything seems to work right.\n","description":"","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Windows Bootloader Issue","uri":"http://ofsaleem.me/en/posts/windows-bootloader-issue/"},{"content":"here\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;stack\u0026rdquo; of my currently playing (single-player or story) games, most current on top\nthis way i can try to make sure i finish what im in the middle of before i start too many other games\nHigurashi When They Cry Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance Opus Magnum Touhou Hero of Ice Fairy Nier Replicant Persona 3 Reload Unbeatable [white label] Hyper Light Drifter The Darkside Detective Death Stranding: Director\u0026rsquo;s Cut Rhythm Doctor Chrono Ark Final Fantasy VII Touhou Artificial Dream in Arcadia The Talos Principle Pikmin 4 Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade Marvel\u0026rsquo;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword Metroid: Dread The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles Persona 5 Strikers Star Wars: Squadrons Cosmic Star Heroine Persona 4 Golden Half-Life: Alyx Doom: Eternal Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Luigi\u0026rsquo;s Mansion 3 Monster Hunter World: Iceborne Resident Evil 2: (Second story, Leon) Earthbound ","description":"","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Currently Playing Stack","uri":"http://ofsaleem.me/en/posts/currently-playing-stack/"},{"content":"i wanted to stream SGDQ into a discord voice channel over the course of the week without needing to keep my desktop on. tried doing it with laptop but it was so chuggy\nwhat i ended up doing was\nget a g2.2xlarge windows instance on aws.\nrdp in to the instance from my laptop log in, get twitch desktop app, log in, get discord desktop app, log in.\nenable audio in rdp settings to play on the local computer\nstart stream to discord channel from twitch\nleave laptop running. this is necessary because the audio will stop otherwise, since windows instances dont really have soundcards and i didnt want to deal with trying virtual audio cable\nit works pretty well. not free though unfortunately, and my laptop still has to be on\nyou can make it so you can minimize rdp windows and itll still work (so the laptop screen doesnt have to be on, i think, but definitely the rdp window itself doesnt have to be fullscreen). instructions for that: https://sahipro.com/docs/faq/remote-desktop-connection.html\nalso want to transfer the rdp connection to console type so that if you do disconnect it doesnt kill the entire stream\nin powershell or cmd: tscon sessionname /dest:console\nwhere sessionname (you can also use sessionid) is determined from\nquery session\ndo this on the windows instance itself\nelastic gpu didnt work because twitch doesnt use opengl to render i guess, which makes sense\ncompute instances were better than t instances but i still had to go to like t3a.2xlarge for it to work right. and to go any higher, it ended up being cheaper to use the g2 instance\nof course im using spot instances as well\n","description":"","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Discord Streamer","uri":"http://ofsaleem.me/en/posts/discord-streamer/"},{"content":"testing 3\nSome third party entries in your sources.list were disabled.
