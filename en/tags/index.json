[{"content":"After upgrading WSL2 to 24.04 Noble, thefuck stopped working with the error ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'imp'.

You can\u0026rsquo;t pip install the latest version either, as you get an error about Python being \u0026ldquo;externally managed\u0026rdquo; now.

It\u0026rsquo;s pretty aged at this point and sort of fails whenever I try to update it. Oftentimes SSH just stops randomly working entirely until I update sshd, but doing a general system upgrade causes the device to fail to boot properly. I get stuck with a rainbow screen on boot and it continues to not respond to SSH. I think what happens involves the out of date hardware trying to run the modern firmware and there\u0026rsquo;s an issue somewhere in the process. That said, I have no clue what causes the SSH problem.\nTo fix the rainbow boot screen the last time I experienced it, I downloaded the entire boot folder located here in the Pi firmware repository and copied it to the boot partition of the Pi\u0026rsquo;s SD card (have to remove it from the device and plug it in to my computer, which is a giant pain).\nThat got me past the rainbow boot screen, but instead I get a systemd failed to start load kernel modules error. However it did respond to SSH again lol! From here I learned you should do:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt full-upgrade\nand NOT sudo apt upgrade which of course is what I did. This got my system to boot and respond to SSH but docker wouldn\u0026rsquo;t launch and systemctl was giving me failed to start create static device nodes in dev. To fix this:\nsudo apt install --reinstall libraspberrypi10 libraspberrypi-{bin,dev,doc} raspberrypi-{kernel,bootloader}\nsudo apt reinstall systemd\nand rebooting it and it was fixed.\nNext problem was WireGuard not starting with /bin/sh: symbol lookup error: /bin/sh: undefined symbol: getpwnam, version GLIBC_2.4. Fix was stopping all containers, then:\ndocker container prune -a -f\nStarting the containers again from my compose files and everything was good. This prune command will delete your existing containers so be aware of that. After this they started correctly, though maybe a docker image prune -a -f would also be necessary in case it\u0026rsquo;s the images that are the problem.\nI suppose the long term fix would be to image the entire SD card with the most up-to-date OS provided for the device, then port my WireHole config over. In the meantime I just have to do this every time I need access to the device again\u0026hellip;currently it\u0026rsquo;s not responding to SSH, but thankfully WireHole will run for literally years without needing any assistance so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t super matter.\n","description":"","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Raspberry Pi 2 Rainbow Screen","uri":"http://ofsaleem.me/en/posts/raspberry-pi-2-rainbow-screen/"},{"content":"The file syncing application I use to sync between my local data and my NAS (probably wisely) skips files that start with a . but I want my .plexmatch files to sync to my NAS too.

Unfortunately Konami has made it pretty difficult to enjoy the entire Metal Gear series on modern systems. All the games are available, but usually not in the same package, none are on PS4, and the recent GOG PC releases are apparently the original not-great releases. There\u0026rsquo;s an HD collection on the PS3, that I planned on playing via PS Now (can\u0026rsquo;t stream PS3 without an HDCP stripper, which I\u0026rsquo;m not about to buy) but that starts with MGS2 for some reason.

It also looks pretty good at 16x and is performant. I will say that there are some issues with textures on polygons having visible seams that pop in and out but I was not able to solve that with any settings, cores, or renderers other than running the game at native resolution, which I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. If you\u0026rsquo;re having issues with the game, try running with these settings and then once you confirm they work well start changing them one by one until it suits your tastes.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also heard that the Duckstation core solves some of the problems if you want to try that core, but it required more than 0 effort to get it to start using my existing saves for the game so I didn\u0026rsquo;t spend any time on it since this config solved my problems.\n","description":"","id":8,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Metal Gear Solid RetroArch Settings","uri":"http://ofsaleem.me/en/posts/metal-gear-solid-retroarch-settings/"},{"content":"over the past day i swapped my computer case to a new one. its real shiny and nice (fractal define 7, all white)\nit was a real PITA to put together because i have so many hard drives, i had to configure the case (which is modular and nearly fully disassemblable) into \u0026ldquo;storage mode\u0026rdquo; which involves taking apart most of the case and putting it back together differently. i also had issues following a lot of the instructions since i was trying probably too hard to plan ahead and make sure cable management would be easy and good when i was done\nspoiler alert unless you have custom length cables no matter how much time you put into cable management its always going to be like 75% good at best. you just can\u0026rsquo;t do enough with on-hand cables of various colors, lengths, thicknesses, materials, flat v. round, etc.\nonce it was finally put together, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t boot. which is an issue, of course. i just swapped cases, why would it not boot?
