[{"content":"over the past day i swapped my computer case to a new one. its real shiny and nice (fractal define 7, all white)\nit was a real PITA to put together because i have so many hard drives, i had to configure the case (which is modular and nearly fully disassemblable) into \u0026ldquo;storage mode\u0026rdquo; which involves taking apart most of the case and putting it back together differently. i also had issues following a lot of the instructions since i was trying probably too hard to plan ahead and make sure cable management would be easy and good when i was done\nspoiler alert unless you have custom length cables no matter how much time you put into cable management its always going to be like 75% good at best. you just can\u0026rsquo;t do enough with on-hand cables of various colors, lengths, thicknesses, materials, flat v. round, etc.\nonce it was finally put together, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t boot. which is an issue, of course. i just swapped cases, why would it not boot? most everything seemed fine in the bios, it detected my main m.2 ssd, but it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t let me boot from it! and my motherboard is one where if you have an m.2 sata SSD installed, it\u0026rsquo;ll disable the 1st regular sata port. i thought that was the issue at first but i had actually not mistakenly plugged a drive in to that disabled port.\nso long story short, part of the case migration was to no longer dual boot with windows and linux. so i didn\u0026rsquo;t actually migrate my linux drive over\u0026hellip;which had refind on it. so my boot manager was now totally missing, since i guess there was no remnant left on my windows os drive (even though it had the EFI partition). it\u0026rsquo;s still quite odd that i wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to boot from the disk manually since all my other random data drives were showing up as boot options in my bios but not the only actual OS disk\nso the fix (also have to make sure you have CSM and secure boot configured correctly) was to boot from a windows install USB (always nice to keep a windows usb and linux usb for shit like this), go into the advanced options and launch a command prompt. i needed to do it this way since the installer didnt detect any OSes and i obviously didn\u0026rsquo;t want to fresh install\nthen\nbootrec /scanos\nwhich will show you if it detects operating systems that aren\u0026rsquo;t in the BCD store, and if it finds what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for,\nbootrec /rebuildbcd\nwhich will give you the option of rebuilding the BCD with that OS.\noddly it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up as a UEFI boot in my bios, but honestly, whatever. it boots consistently and everything seems to work right.\n","description":"","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Windows Bootloader Issue","uri":"http://ofsaleem.me/posts/windows-bootloader-issue/"},{"content":"here\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;stack\u0026rdquo; of my currently playing (single-player or story) games, most current on top\nthis way i can try to make sure i finish what im in the middle of before i start too many other games\n Disco Elysium Need for Speed Heat Shin Megami Tensei IV Persona 4 Golden Half-Life: Alyx Doom: Eternal Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Luigi\u0026rsquo;s Mansion 3 AI: The Somnium Files Monster Hunter World: Iceborne Resident Evil 2: (Second story, Leon) Metro 2033 Redux  ","description":"","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Currently Playing Stack","uri":"http://ofsaleem.me/posts/currently-playing-stack/"},{"content":"i wanted to stream SGDQ into a discord voice channel over the course of the week without needing to keep my desktop on. tried doing it with laptop but it was so chuggy\nwhat i ended up doing was\nget a g2.2xlarge windows instance on aws.\nrdp in to the instance from my laptop log in, get twitch desktop app, log in, get discord desktop app, log in.\nenable audio in rdp settings to play on the local computer\nstart stream to discord channel from twitch\nleave laptop running. this is necessary because the audio will stop otherwise, since windows instances dont really have soundcards and i didnt want to deal with trying virtual audio cable\nit works pretty well. not free though unfortunately, and my laptop still has to be on\nyou can make it so you can minimize rdp windows and itll still work (so the laptop screen doesnt have to be on, i think, but definitely the rdp window itself doesnt have to be fullscreen). instructions for that: https://sahipro.com/docs/faq/remote-desktop-connection.html\nalso want to transfer the rdp connection to console type so that if you do disconnect it doesnt kill the entire stream\nin powershell or cmd: tscon sessionname /dest:console\nwhere sessionname (you can also use sessionid) is determined from\nquery session\ndo this on the windows instance itself\nelastic gpu didnt work because twitch doesnt use opengl to render i guess, which makes sense\ncompute instances were better than t instances but i still had to go to like t3a.2xlarge for it to work right. and to go any higher, it ended up being cheaper to use the g2 instance\nof course im using spot instances as well\n","description":"","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Discord Streamer","uri":"http://ofsaleem.me/posts/discord-streamer/"},{"content":"testing 3\nSome third party entries in your sources.list were disabled.
